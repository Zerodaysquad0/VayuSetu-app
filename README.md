# üå¨Ô∏è RAHUL_WORK - VayuSetu Backend (Air + Weather Data)

This folder contains the **backend logic** for the VayuSetu project ‚Äî a tool designed to help monitor **air quality (PM2.5)** and **weather conditions** across districts, starting with **rural Bihar**.

If you're a collaborator, this is where you'll find everything related to:
- pulling data from APIs,
- cleaning and smoothing it,
- and forecasting PM2.5 levels using machine learning.
